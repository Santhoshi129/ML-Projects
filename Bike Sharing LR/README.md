ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Linear Regression Bike Sharing Project repository! In this project, I've implemented a simple linear regression model to predict bike sharing demand based on various environmental and seasonal factors.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview: This project aims to forecast the number of bikes that will be rented in a given hour using historical bike rental data. By analyzing features such as temperature, humidity, windspeed, and time of day, the model predicts bike demand with reasonable accuracy.

ðŸ“ˆ Results: The trained linear regression model demonstrates promising performance in predicting bike rental demand, with insights into which features contribute most significantly to the predictions.
